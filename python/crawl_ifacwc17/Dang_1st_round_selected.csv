The presented approach enables Plug-and-Play (PnP) operations, meaning that DGUs can be arbitrarily added or removed without compromising the overall ImG stability. The main feature of our approach is that, differently from (Riverso et al., 2015), the proposed PnP design algorithm is line-independent. This implies that (i) the synthesis of each local controller does not require anymore the model of power lines connecting neighboring DGUs, and (ii) whenever a new DGU is plugged-in, DGUs physically connected to it do not have to retune their regulators. Theoretical results are validated by simulating in PSCAD the behavior of a 10-DGUs ImG.

A novel scalable event-based distributed Kalman filtering algorithm is proposed to reduce the burden of communications between sensors. A deterministic triggering mechanism depending on a lower bound of the true information matrix is developed. Also, the stability conclusion of the distributed filter is provided under certain conditions of collective observability and suitable connectivity. The numerical simulation illustrates the feasibility as well as the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

It is shown that, by using the concepts of polyhedral Lyapunov functions and superstability, the problem can be recast into a nonconvex constrained Polynomial Optimization Problem (POP). In turn, this problem can be relaxed into a sequence of convex Semi-Definite Programs (SDPs) by resorting to moments-based polynomial optimization techniques. Further, by exploiting the sparsity pattern exhibited by the problem, we show that the original POP can be equivalently reformulated as a SDP problem with a rank-1 constraint. An efficient algorithm is proposed to solve the later, by seeking low rank solution through a re-weighted nuclear norm minimization.

The proposed method utilizes a matrix-splitting scheme common to successive over-relaxation (SOR) iterative methods and may be considered a generalization of many existing fast gradient-based methods for MPC. We comment on parameter choices for global convergence and demonstrate the efficiency of the ensuing algorithms using a simulation example.

The system is partitioned into sub-units and local MHE algorithms are used to estimate both the local states and the possible faults, modeled as additive signals on the inputs and/or the outputs. A preliminary convergence analysis of the algorithm is reported and a simulation example is discussed to witness the performance of the approach.

In this work, we investigate the separation of estimation and control in event-triggered discrete-time stochastic systems which are physically interconnected. The information pattern and resource constraints on the system can undermine the separation property and lead to a problem which is difficult to solve. For the class of problems considered, we investigate the constraints and information pattern between the controllers such that separation can be applied in solving the optimal control problem.

The two LMPC designs can drive the closed-loop state to a safety region (a level set within the stability region where process operational safety is ensured) at a prescribed rate, and also can drive the closed-loop state to a safe level set within the stability region of another steady-state. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes, a comparison between the safety-LMPC, which effectively integrates feedback control and safety considerations, and the classical LMPC method is presented with a chemical process example.

The multiple models can represent various operating conditions such as system faults or failures, or arise from model structure uncertainty. The paper presents a stochastic nonlinear model predictive control (intl{snmpc}) approach with endogenous learning for active discrimination between the competing models based on closed-loop system observations. The system learning is endogenized through explicit inclusion of a model discrimination measure into the stochastic optimal control problem, which facilitates probabilistic discrimination between the predictions of multiple models. The control approach uses a Bayesian estimation algorithm for recursive estimation of the probabilities that represent the degree to which each model predicts the online system observations. The performance of the proposed intl{snmpc} approach with active model discrimination is demonstrated for closed-loop fault diagnosis.

IPD eliminates the need to communicate local constraints and cost functions for all variables that relate to internal dynamics and objectives of the agents. Instead, by using embedded barrier functions, the problem is solved in the space of coupling variables, which are in general much lower in dimension compared to internal variables of individual agents. Therefore, IPD contributes to both problem size reduction as well as data hiding. The method is a distributed version of the primal barrier method, with locally and globally feasible iterations and faster convergence compared to first-order distributed optimization methods. Hence, IPD is suitable for early termination in time-critical applications. We illustrate these attractive properties of the IPD method with a distributed Model Predictive Control (MPC) application in the context of smart-grids, where a collection of commercial buildings provide voltage support to a distribution grid operator.

Most of the developments are driven by the fast evolution of embedded systems for the acquisition, perception and communication modules. However, the fast growing of the automated vehicle market demands modern tools for validation, integration and testing of these new embedded functionalities, specially related to Advanced Driving Assistance Systems (ADAS). In this paper, a testing methodology for validation of path planning and control algorithms for current and future automated vehicles is presented. A high degree of modularity and adaptability have been considered in the design of the proposed method. It is based on a software tool for vehicle modeling, called Dynacar, which allows a good trajectory definition, cooperative maneuvers interaction and virtual validation. Different types of vehicles, scenarios (i.e.: urban, interurban, highways under different environmental conditions) and controllers can be tested. Moreover, Hardware-In-the-Loop configuration (i.e. electronic control units) can be also tested. Simulation results show a good performance in the implementation and configuration of urban scenarios, using different controllers in the proposed framework.

The multi-robot formation system consists of the trajectory tracking of leader robot and the leader-follower formation controlling. Their kinematic error systems can be reformulated as a convex nonlinear minimization problem by the NMPC method and can be transformed into a constrained quadratic programming (QP) optimization problem. To solve this QP problem online efficiently, a general projection neural network (GPNN) is applied to obtain the optimal solution, which includes the optimal inputs of the formation system. Compare to other existing leader-follower approaches, the proposed nonlinear MPC method can take the input and state constraints of system into consideration. In the end of this work, simulations of the trajectory tracking and multi-robot formation are performed to verify the effectiveness of the developed strategy.

To this aim, we assume to have at our disposal a discrete sequence of trials only, as it happens, for instance, when we iteratively run a software, with new input data at each iteration, in order to achieve the desired output value. In this paper we prove that, if the polytope is robustly non-singular (or has full row rank, in the general non-square case), then a suitable discrete-time tuning law drives the output to the desired point. The computation of the tuning law is based on a convex-optimisation problem to be solved on-line. An application example is proposed to show the effectiveness of the approach.

However, they do not guarantee the closed-loop stability and performance of multiagent systems in the presence of physical interconnections or changes in operating conditions of agents. In this paper, we propose a class of state- and output-coupled linear multiagent systems where each agent is characterized by its individual unknown operating point. Under the effect of these varying operating points of agents, we propose the distributed decoupling problem in order to mitigate the effects of interconnections, and ensure that each agent can operate at its individual operating point independent of its neighbors. We reformulate this decoupling task, and propose two linear quadratic regulator-based distributed leaderless consensus algorithms using coupled-state and -output measurements. In both scenarios, we establish sufficient conditions guaranteeing global exponential decoupling of agents.

In this paper we have proposed a passive architecture of CPS, in which a passive dynamical plant is controlled by a passive physical PD controller via a passive wireless network in presence of markovian loss and delay, due to passive behaviour of the plant and controller certain range of random losses are not effecting the performance of the robot. Furthermore we have used wave variable transformation to compensate the larger time delay, and wave variable encoder (WVE) decoder (WVD) to compensate second order markovian loss occuring in the communication network. Preserving the passivity of the transmitted signal between plant and controller delay and losses will not effect the signal strength and its behaviour is smooth. We have validate our theory using simulation results.

Employing the idea of selective pole shift based on LQR method, our approach provides a systematic framework to synthesize fully distributed consensus controllers which have low rank and non-conservative coupling strengths. In addition, our approach enables to broaden the class of randomly switching topologies in which the switching component graphs need not to be balanced. Next, we show that all aforementioned remarkable features also apply to the context that dynamics of agents are heterogeneous caused by parametric multiplicative uncertainties in their models. Finally, a numerical example is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed theoretical approach.

We highlight a set of challenges that deserve investigation by means of distributed computation methods.

This paper introduces two safety frameworks that can be applied together with any learning method for ensuring constraint satisfaction in a network of uncertain systems, which are coupled in the dynamics and in the state constraints. The proposed techniques make use of a safe set to modify control inputs that may compromise system safety, while accepting safe inputs from the learning procedure. Two different safe sets for distributed systems are proposed by extending recent results for structured invariant sets. The sets differ in their dynamical allocation to local sets and provide different trade-offs between required communication and achieved set size. The proposed algorithms are proven to keep the system in the safe set at all times and their effectiveness and behavior is illustrated in a numerical example.

In this study, we deal with an aggregate state control problem of a large-scale discrete-time system with networked controllers. First, we derive conditions on the parameters of the controller such that the aggregate state converges to zero with an assigned rate. Next, we design an optimal controller which minimizes components' dissatisfaction under the aggregate state condition. Moreover, we compare the obtained solution with the solution of the original optimization problem without the aggregate state condition, and clarify the effect of the network topology to the solution. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through a simulation.

We investigate stability and disturbance amplification if the string length increases, where the vehicles utilise weighted information from multiple vehicles ahead and behind. We find a condition, independent of the linear controller used, for the weighting factors that is necessary for stability of long platoons. In the second part we investigate disturbance amplification for stable systems. We show that while string instability is unavoidable with an extended but limited range, a communication range that increases with the vehicle platoon size can lead to string stability.

The network constraints are moved into the cost using the Lagrange multipliers. For solving the dual problem we propose a fully distributed dual fast gradient algorithm having sublinear rate of convergence in terms of dual suboptimality but also in terms of primal suboptimality and feasibility violation for the last generated primal iterate. The convergence analysis relies on the Lipschitz property of dual function and fast gradient schemes. The main application we consider is the DC optimal power flow problem from an electric energy system. Our approach allows to carry out an optimal dispatch for each bus to be done independently and in parallel while still achieving the global economical optimum of the whole electric system. The newly developed algorithms can be run distributively, as we show on several numerical simulations using classical IEEE bus test cases.

Running a Kalman filter on every node in such a network is computationally intensive; in particular the matrix inversion in the Kalman gain update step is expensive. In this paper, we extend previous results in distributed Kalman filtering and large-scale machine learning to propose a gradient descent step for updating an estimate of the error covariance matrix; this is then embedded and analyzed in the context of distributed Kalman filtering. We provide properties of the resulting filters, in addition to a number of applications throughout the paper.

A sparse LQG controller requires fewer communication channels with the networked system. The bidirectional communication implies that the column-block-sparsity pattern of the Kalman filter and the row-block-sparsity pattern of the state feedback controller must be the same. We develop a two-step procedure: the first step being a sparsity-promoting design of the Kalman filter and the second step leveraging the structure identified in the first step to design the respective controllers. In both steps we employ the Alternating Directions Method of Multipliers (ADMM) and show its effectiveness for the identification and the structural LQG design. In particular, ADMM allows us to decompose the structured LQG problem into a sequence of convex quadratic problems that can be solved efficiently. We demonstrate via numerical experiments that our approach results in sparse controllers whose performance is comparable to that of the fully centralized controllers.

Here, our focus is on a class of methods that approximates the probability distribution of the states of a stochastic optimal control problem with uncertain parameters by using a sigma point approach. This leads to a large but structured optimal control problem comprising a number of carefully selected uncertainty scenarios in order to enforce chance constraints. The approach achieves accuracies that are equivalent to a third order moment expansion. However, as the resulting large but structured optimal control problem is challenging to solve with existing numerical tools, this paper proposes a tailored distributed algorithm that exploits the particular structure that arises when applying the sigma point approach. The method is based on a tailored variant of the recently proposed augmented Lagrangian based alternating direction inexact Newton (ALADIN) algorithm. The approach is illustrated by the application to a benchmark case study involving a predator-prey-fishing model.

This paper proposes a novel parallelizable algorithm, which solves the coordination problem at traffic intersections under a given precedence order by using a tailored variant of the augmented Lagrangian based alternating direction inexact Newton method (ALADIN). Here, each vehicle solves its own optimal control problem and exchanges information about arrival and departure times at the intersection with its neighbors such that collisions are avoided. We illustrate the performance of ALADIN by analyzing two scenarios, one during rush hour and one at low-traffic conditions.

The proposed approach uses the tube MPC concept for robustness to handle the disturbances induced by mutual interactions between subsystems; however, the main novelty here is to replace the conventional linear disturbance rejection controller with a second MPC controller, as is done in tube-based nonlinear MPC. In the distributed setting, this has the advantages that the disturbance rejection controller is able to consider the plans of neighbours, and the reliance on explicit robust invariant sets is removed.

The relation is made explicit in the form of a theorem that presents sufficient conditions for global stabilizability. It is shown that constraint admissibility of local robust controllers is sufficient for the global closed-loop system to be stable, and how these controllers are related to more complex forms of control such as tube-based distributed model predictive control implementations.

In this paper, we use the forward-backward envelope, a real-valued continuously differentiable penalty function, to recast the dual of the original nonsmooth problem as an unconstrained problem which we solve via the limited-memory BFGS algorithm. We show that the proposed method leads to a significant improvement of the convergence rate without increasing much the computational cost per iteration.

The closed-loop performance and computational effort of employing centralized and sequential distributed MPC structures is analyzed for a reactor-separator integrated process.

Unfortunately, they also pose privacy risks by revealing sensitive information about consumers. In this work, techniques that exploit the benefits of smart meters and at the same time mitigate privacy risks are explored. More specifically, we consider the control of local energy storage devices of a group of consumers with the goal of minimizing energy cost and providing aggregate load smoothing to the grid. A differentially private distributed model predictive controller (MPC) is proposed by extending a framework recently proposed in the literature for this application. By using a distributed proximal gradient algorithm, the energy cost of consumers is minimized while keeping the load profile of each consumer private. Aggregate load smoothing is achieved by exchanging net consumption information between consumers. Since information about the consumer load profiles could be inferred from theses exchanges, the proposed controller is designed to ensure Differential Privacy (DP) and to protect this information. Numerical experiments are used to study 30 consumers. The resulting trade-off between privacy and performance is studied as well as the effects of having a trustworthy or untrustworthy mediator handling the information exchanges between consumers.

We adopt a ``reduced Hessian'' approach for handling the equality constraints that arise in the well-known ``banded'' formulation of MPC (in which the predicted states are not eliminated). Our key observation is that a banded basis exists for the null space of the banded equality-constraint matrix, and that this leads to a QP of the same size as the ``condensed'' formulation of MPC problems, which is considerably smaller than the ``banded'' formulation. We use the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) - which is known to be particularly suitable for embedded implementations - to solve this smaller QP problem. Our C implementation results for a particular MPC example (a 9-state, 3-input quadrotor) show that our proposed algorithm is about 4 times faster than an existing well-performing ADMM variant (``indirect indicator&quot; ADMM or ``iiADMM'') and 3 times faster than the well-known QP solver CVXGEN. The convergence rate and code size of the proposed ADMM variant is also comparable with iiADMM.

Such constraints are non-convex and the resulting optimization problem is known to be hard to solve. We propose a novel generalization of this problem and demonstrate that it is equivalent to the original sparsity-constrained problem if a certain weighting term is sufficiently large. We use the proximal gradient method to solve our generalized problem, and show that under certain regularity assumptions on the objective function the algorithm converges to a local minimum. We further propose an updating heuristic for the weighting parameter, ensuring that the solution produced is locally optimal for the original sparsity constrained problem. Numerical results show that our algorithm outperforms other algorithms proposed in the literature.

Existing prediction- correction methods have been shown to work well for unconstrained convex problems and for settings where obtaining the inverse of the Hessian of the cost function can be computationally affordable. The prediction-correction algorithm proposed in this paper addresses the limitations of existing methods by tackling constrained problems and by designing a first-order prediction step that relies on the Hessian of the cost function (and do not require the computation of its inverse). Analytical results are established to quantify the tracking error. Numerical simulations corroborate the analytical results and showcase performance and benefits of the algorithms.

However, when different VCS operate simultaneously in the vehicle, the global performance could be degraded because of the cross-coupling dynamics. In this article the design of decentralized controllers for the steering and velocity subsystems is presented. The resulting control scheme reduces the cross/coupling among the steering and longitudinal dynamics. These results were achieved by proposing a more complete vehicle model and analyzing the cross-coupling using a multivariable analysis and design framework known as Individual Channel Analysis and Design (IChAD). These results can be extended for other coupled subsystems.

Starting from a given feasible initial guess, the algorithm iteratively improves the value of the cost function with guaranteed feasible solutions at every iteration step, and is thus suitable for MPC applications in which hard constraints are important. The proposed iterative approach involves solving local optimization problems consisting of only few subsystems, depending on the flexible choice of decomposition and the sparsity structure of the couplings. This makes our approach more applicable to situations where the number of subsystems is large, the coupling is sparse, and local communication is available. We also provide a method for checking a posteriori centralized optimality of the converging solution, using comparison between Lagrange multipliers of the local problems. Furthermore, a theoretical result on convergence to optimality for a particular distributed setting is also provided.

The presented direct transcription approach uses convex optimisation method to obtain a minimum-time control for robot manipulators. One subset of motion planning is the waiter motion problem that consists of moving a tablet from one place to another as fast as possible, avoiding the slip of the object that is placed upon it. In this paper the direct transcription method is presented in order to solve the waiter problem. This path tracking problem is also approximated by sequential two dimensional second-order cone programs (SOCP) using nonlinear change of variables. The computational benefit of the sequential method compared to the direct transcription approach is presented. The waiter motion problem is validated by real-life experimental results with a 6-DoF robotic arm.

The system constraints in presence of system disturbances are tightened along the prediction horizon by means of the proposed interval arithmetic. Considering that system variables in the WDN model are also subject to some algebraic equations. These algebraic equations should be satisfieed when the disturbances have effects on those system variables. The EMPC controller is designed with adding the terminal state constraint. The periodically optimal steady states are obtained by employing a periodic EMPC planner with the nominal model. This periodic steady states are subsequently used to be terminal states. The on-line robust constraint satisfactions are implemented into the robust periodic EMPC controller. Finally, the proposed control strategy is verified using a case study.

This leads to enormous communication when using centralized controllers. Controller networks can reduce this effort by splitting the control task to smaller nodes, which do not need the full system information. The complex behavior of such systems can be modeled by multilinear time-invariant (MTI) systems in situations where linear models may fail. In this paper a method is proposed that determines a decentralized state feedback controller structure, that has an acceptable performance loss compared to the centralized case by multiple linearizations of the MTI plant. During operation of the controller the feedback gain is adapted to the current operating point. Application to a complex heating system example shows promising results.

However, a deep understanding of the internal structure and behaviour of the automatically generated code is required in order to conduct later phases of the lifecycle, including validation of non-functional requirements such as real-time properties. The paper describes the integration of a timing analysis tool with TASTE, a model-driven environment developed under the auspices of the European Space Agency. A study of the influence of using an MDE approach on timing analysis techniques, along with figures on the proportion of automated and human-written code in a representative example of a spacecraft attitude control system is included in the paper.

The limited and time-varying computational resources can make the control system run in an open-loop fashion which may severely degrade the system performance or even destabilize the system. This issue is dealt with by producing more than one forward control predictions when abundant computational resources are available, and then using these forward control predictions to close the system when the computational resources are insufficient to calculate real-time control signal. This achievement is made without additional requirement for the computational resources and can be regarded as a useful completion of the scheduling algorithms. With a controller designed using a modified model predictive control method, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is successfully illustrated by a numerical example.

The players are only aware of their own cost functions as well as the action space of all players. We develop a relatively fast algorithm within the framework of inexact-ADMM. It requires a communication graph for the information exchange between the players as well as a few mild assumptions on cost functions. The convergence proof of the algorithm to an NE of the game is then provided. Moreover, the convergence rate is investigated via simulations.

We first address the challenging issue of providing a mathematical model for an irrigation system with an inherent complex dynamics using the Lattice Boltzmann (LB) method. Next, we discuss different control implementation strategies (i.e., decentralized and distributed strategies) and how the cooperation among local MPC controllers can be included to improve the performance of the overall system. For simulations, a particular benchmark of an irrigation canal is considered. Comparisons through simulations among the proposed control approaches validate the benefits of the cooperative distributed control approach.

The control model of the WDN is built by means of nonlinear differential-algebraic equations in which both the hydraulic pressure and flow variables are taken into account. The model allows the controller to consider minimum pressure constraints at the demands. A periodic terminal constraint is employed in order to guarantee closed-loop stability. The prediction horizon is modified on-line in order to guarantee convergence to the optimal periodic trajectory. The proposed control strategy is verified with the case study of the Richmond water network in a realistic hydraulic simulator. Although there are modeling errors between the control model and hydraulic model, the closed-loop system converges to a sub-optimal periodic trajectory satisfying all the constraints.

However, the convergence rate was not examined so far. In this work, we evaluate the convergence rate and convergence time of reverse Ishikawa-Nesterov learning scheme for a deterministic fractional mean-field games. The fractional mean-field game problem given by a fractional controlled state dynamics and payoff that measures the gap between a mean-field term and the fractional integral of the state. First, we prove that the problem is well-posed and has a unique best response to mean-field. Second, we derive conditions for convergence of the reverse Ishikawa-based learning scheme and provide the error gap. Finally, we show that the reverse Ishikawa-Nesterov's technique outperforms the standard descent methods.

To linearize the dynamics, this paper introduces a virtual vehicle of the robot. Then a feedback linearization and a local feedback law transform each dynamics of the virtual vehicle into two SISO positive and stable linear systems. Consequently, the dynamics of the virtual vehicles satisfy the properties of the interconnected positive systems. Experimental results as well as numerical examples including leader-follower formation control for the mobile robots are illustrated.
Dang 1st round selected	12.07.2017 Wed.	13:30-13:50	WeM24.1	Distributed Model Predictive Control with Event-Based Optimization (I)	Distributed model predictive control (DMPC) methods that are based on iterative optimization algorithms normally require a large number of communications between the controllers, especially when the number of subsystems is large. This can easily result in overloading the network which is normally shared between many different users. Therefore methods to reduce the load on the network while still satisfying convergence, feasibility, stability, and a certain level of performance are of a great importance. In this paper a novel event-based optimization algorithm is provided to reduce the number of communications in DMPC methods that are based on dual decomposition.
Dang 1st round selected	12.07.2017 Wed.	14:30-14:50	WeM27.4	Online Constraint Adaptation in Economic Model Predictive Control	In economic model predictive control (EMPC), the standard quadratic objective function of MPC is replaced with an economic objective such that the controller directly optimizes the economic performance of the plant. However, economic objective functions are likely to be monotone in some input direction, and this will typically lead to operation with constraints active. Operating the plant with active constraints is not economically robust; even small disturbances or errors could cause constraint violations which may lead to large costs. In this paper we address this issue by adding margins to the constraints in order to force the plant to operate in the interior of the feasible set, thereby providing some robustness to uncertainty. To determine the magnitude of these margins, we introduce an outer loop which optimizes the margins online based on measurements of the closed-loop economic performance. Our approach is simple to implement and introduces essentially no computational overhead as compared to the nominal EMPC problem. In addition, only minimal knowledge of the uncertainties present in the system is required.
Dang 1st round selected	12.07.2017 Wed.	13:30-18:00	WeM33.2	Demonstration of PISim - Software for Teaching Chemical Process Control (I)	PISim is a new piece of software for teaching and learning in process control. PISim bridges the gap between industry standard piping and instrumentation diagrams of control systems and the physical interface that operators and engineers see. The software allows control systems to be created on a P&ID and automatically generates virtual representations of the physical devices that can then be attached, by the learner or by an instructor, to simulated control panels and displays. The learner can test their control ideas using one of several built-in simulated processes. In addition, PISim includes a lesson management system that allows instructors to present instructional material to students and provides an easy way to check students’ control configurations and provide instant feedback. PISim has already been used in two undergraduate control classes at Strathclyde University and is being prepared for general release.
Dang 1st round selected	12.07.2017 Wed.	17:20-17:40	WeP12.5	Group Testing Game (I)	Group testing offers a cost/time-beneficial method to identify all, but few, infected individuals (defective items in general) among a large set of individuals (items). In a group testing scheme, a series of tests are performed on groups of individuals rather than single individuals. A test on a group determines whether the group contains at least one infected individual. This paper investigates the classical group testing problem from a game-theoretic perspective, where every individual, once called for a test, decides to comply with or defy the call. In this framework, an individual's decision is driven by his knowledge of his well-being, that is healthy or infected. This leads to the so-called group testing game which is formulated in this work. Some simplified versions of the general game as a team game is then presented and analyzed, that result in some novel, generalized group testing problems to be addressed in future work.
Dang 1st round selected	12.07.2017 Wed.	17:00-17:20	WeP24.4	Event-Triggered Consensus Seeking under Non-Uniform Time-Varying Delays (I)	In this paper, we study consensus seeking for a class of linear multi-agent systems (MAS) subject to the inevitable imperfections of packet-based networked communication. These imperfections include unknown non-uniform time-varying transmission delays and limited communication resources. To reduce the utilization of communication resources, we propose a dynamic event-triggered control scheme resulting in aperiodic transmission of information between agents. The proposed framework leads to event-triggered controllers that guarantee the MAS to asymptotically reach consensus, strictly positive lower bounds on the inter-event times and robustness for unknown non-uniform time-varying delays in terms of maximum allowable delays.
